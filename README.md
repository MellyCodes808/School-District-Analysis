# School-District-Analysis
 
The purpose of this analysis is to summurize data from 15 different schools to identify top performing schools in reading and math scores, and to see if metrics such as school type ( district / charter ) , school size , funding or grade had any correlations.
After discovering that Thomas High schools 9th grade metrics were flawed we will point out the differences after removing the inflated score from the dataset.
